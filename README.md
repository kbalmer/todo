# classic to-do list

* The aim of this project was to gain more experience in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS.

* During the process of developing the new table of tasks, ajax requests were implemented as well as 
HTML templating.  

* I've found these are useful and powerful tools for generating HTML on the webpage while maintaining a 
smoother user experience.
